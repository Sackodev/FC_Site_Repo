About Me Text::

As a fifth-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Dallas, I am passionate about teaching and sharing my knowledge with others. Currently, I am teaching Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory, a course that I thoroughly enjoy. Additionally, I have previously taught Principles of Macroeconomics and Mathematics for Economists at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León in my hometown of Monterrey, Mexico.

My research interests lie in the field of Monetary Policy in Mexico, where I utilize Time Series models to conduct my analysis. I find this work to be both challenging and rewarding, as it allows me to contribute to a field that has important implications for the economy of my home country.

When I'm not busy with my academic work, I enjoy running, climbing, and making new friends. I also have a strong connection to my faith and enjoy attending church. Lastly, I can never resist indulging in some delicious tacos from my hometown of Monterrey, N.L. in Mexico.

I am excited to be available for interviews at the 2021 Virtual ASSA Meetings, and I look forward to discussing my research and teaching experiences with those in attendance.
