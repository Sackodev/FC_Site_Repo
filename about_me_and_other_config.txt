About Me Text::

As an economist at Banco de México, I am passionate about conducting research in the fields of Macroeconomics, Monetary Policy, and Regional Economics. Currently, I have the privilege of teaching Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León in my hometown of Monterrey, Mexico, and I thoroughly enjoy this course.

My research interests primarily revolve around Monetary Policy in Mexico, where I employ Time Series models to conduct in-depth analyses. I find this work to be both challenging and rewarding, as it allows me to contribute to a field with significant implications for my home country's economy.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests and hobbies. I relish activities such as running and climbing, which provide a perfect balance to my academic life. Building connections and making new friends is also something I greatly value. Furthermore, I have a deep connection to my faith and find solace in attending church services.

Last but certainly not least, I have an insatiable craving for the delectable tacos from my hometown of Monterrey, N.L. in Mexico.

I am excited to make myself available for interviews at the 2023 Virtual ASSA Meetings and am looking forward to engaging in discussions about my research and teaching experiences with those in attendance.
