About Me Text::

I am a fifth year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am currently teaching Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory, which is something that I really enjoy. In the past I have also had the opportunity to teach Principles of Macroeconomics and Mathematics for Economists at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León in my hometown in Mexico.

I really enjoy the analysis and research on Monetary Policy in Mexico using Time Series models.

Personally, I really enjoy running, climbing, making new friends, going to the church and eating some delicious tacos from my hometown, Monterrey, N.L. in Mexico.

I will be available for interviews at the 2021 Virtual ASSA Meetings.
